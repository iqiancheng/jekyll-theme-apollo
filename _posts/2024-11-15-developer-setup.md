As we approach the end of 2024, I wanted to share my current developer setup. This year, I've focused on minimalism and ergonomics.

## Hardware

I've switched to a fully wireless setup to keep my desk clean.

| Category | Item | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Laptop** | MacBook Pro M3 Max | The beast. Handles everything I throw at it. |
| **Monitor** | Dell UltraSharp 32" | 4K resolution is a must for coding. |
| **Keyboard** | HHKB Professional Hybrid | Topre switches are life-changing. |
| **Mouse** | Logitech MX Master 3S | Silent clicks and infinite scroll. |

## Software

My software stack hasn't changed much, but I've refined my config files.

### VS Code Extensions

*   **Vim**: I can't live without Vim keybindings.
*   **ESLint**: Essential for keeping JavaScript clean.
*   **GitLens**: Supercharges the built-in Git capabilities.

### Terminal

I use `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh`. Here is a snippet of my `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Enable plugins
plugins=(git docker zsh-autosuggestions syntax-highlighting)

# Set theme
ZSH_THEME="spaceship"

# Aliases
alias z="z_jump"
alias g="git"
alias d="docker"
```

## Conclusion

It's not about having the most expensive gear, but about finding what works for you.
