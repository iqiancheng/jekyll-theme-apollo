I am a minimalist. I believe that every object in my life must spark joy or serve a purpose. The same applies to my digital life.

## The Philosophy

We are bombarded with information. Notifications, popups, infinite scrolls. It's exhausting.

My blog is my sanctuary.

*   No ads.
*   No trackers.
*   No clutter.

## Why Apollo?

This theme embodies the minimalist philosophy.

1.  **Whitespace**: It uses whitespace to let the content breathe.
2.  **Typography**: It uses a clean, readable font stack.
3.  **Focus**: It strips away everything that isn't the content.

## The Result

A reading experience that respects the reader. A writing experience that respects the writer.
