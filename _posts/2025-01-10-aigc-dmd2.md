Generative AI for images has seen a paradigm shift with the introduction of **DMD2** (Distribution Matching Distillation 2).

## What is DMD2?

Traditional diffusion models require multiple steps (denoising iterations) to generate an image, which is slow. **DMD2** distills these models into a "one-step" or "few-step" generator without significant loss in quality.

### Advantages

1.  **Speed**: Generates high-quality images in milliseconds.
2.  **Consistency**: Better adherence to complex prompts.
3.  **Efficiency**: Runs on consumer-grade hardware.

## Impact on Creative Workflows

With tools like DMD2, real-time generation becomes possible. Imagine painting a rough sketch and having it turn into a photorealistic image instantly as you draw.

## Code Example: Simple Diffusion Pipeline

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
    
image.save("astronaut_rides_horse.png")
```
