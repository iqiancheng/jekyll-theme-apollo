I am a lover of words. I explore the beauty of language across cultures. This theme's excellent support for multilingual typography makes it a joy to present poetry.

## The Japanese Haiku

A haiku captures a moment in time. 5-7-5 syllables.

> 古池や (Furu ike ya)
> 蛙飛び込む (Kawazu tobikomu)
> 水の音 (Mizu no oto)

*The old pond,*
*A frog jumps in:*
*Plop! Sound of water.*
*- Bashō*

## The Chinese Tang Poem

Tang poetry is structured, rhyming, and profound.

**静夜思 (Thoughts in the Silent Night)**
*Li Bai*

> 床前明月光，
> 疑是地上霜。
> 举头望明月，
> 低头思故乡。

*Moonlight before my bed,*
*Perhaps frost on the ground.*
*I lift my head and gaze at the moon,*
*I lower my head and think of my home.*

## The Aesthetic of Text

Notice how the theme handles the spacing and font weight. It respects the gravity of the words. For a literature blog, the reading experience is everything.
