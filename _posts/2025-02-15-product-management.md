As a Product Manager, communication is my primary tool. I need to convey complex timelines and strategies clearly. This theme's support for **Mermaid Gantt charts** is invaluable.

## The Roadmap

Here is how we planned the Q1 launch of our new mobile app feature.

## Prioritization Framework

I often use the RICE score to prioritize features:

1.  **Reach**: How many people will this impact?
2.  **Impact**: How much will this move the needle?
3.  **Confidence**: How sure are we?
4.  **Effort**: How many person-months?

## Clear Communication

The clean typography of this theme ensures that my stakeholders focus on the plan, not the formatting. It's professional, crisp, and effective.
