In a world of cluttered interfaces and heavy frameworks, **Apollo** stands out by doing less, better.

## The Problem with Modern Themes

I used to spend more time tweaking my blog's sidebar widgets than actually writing.
*   **Bloat**: Too many JavaScript libraries.
*   **Distraction**: Readers get lost in the UI.
*   **Speed**: Slow load times hurt SEO.

## Enter Apollo

Apollo is a breath of fresh air. It's a port of the famous Hexo theme, now optimized for Jekyll.

### 1. Focus on Content
The single-column layout ensures that your writing is the star of the show. No sidebars, no popups, just you and your reader.

### 2. Blazing Fast
With no heavy dependencies (jQuery is optional), the theme loads instantly.

### 3. Developer Friendly
It supports everything a tech blogger needs out of the box:
*   Syntax Highlighting (Atom One Light)
*   MathJax for formulas
*   Mermaid for diagrams

```yaml
# _config.yml is simple
title: Apollo
description: A Blog Powered By Jekyll
```

## Conclusion

If you want a blog that respects your content and your readers' time, give Apollo a try.
