As a researcher in the history of technology, I require a platform that supports long-form content and structured argumentation. This blog serves as my digital notebook for my upcoming thesis.

## The Mechanical Age

It all began with Charles Babbage and the **Analytical Engine**. While never fully built in his lifetime, it laid the groundwork for the programmable computer.

> "The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves." - Ada Lovelace

## The Vacuum Tube Era

The ENIAC, completed in 1945, marked the beginning of electronic general-purpose computing. It was massive, consuming 150 kW of electricity.

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Size**: Occupied a large room.
2.  **Input**: Plugboards and switches.
3.  **Speed**: 5,000 additions per second.

## The Transistor Revolution

The invention of the transistor at Bell Labs changed everything. It allowed computers to become smaller, faster, and more reliable.

## Conclusion

The journey from Babbage's gears to today's silicon chips is a testament to human ingenuity. This theme's clean typography makes reading long historical accounts a pleasure, free from the distractions of modern web design.
