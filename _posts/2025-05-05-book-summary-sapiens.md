## The Three Revolutions

Harari divides human history into three major revolutions:

1.  **The Cognitive Revolution** (70,000 years ago)
    *   Emergence of fictive language.
    *   Ability to gossip and cooperate in large groups.
2.  **The Agricultural Revolution** (12,000 years ago)
    *   Domestication of plants and animals.
    *   *Quote*: "History's biggest fraud." (Harari argues it made life harder for the average individual).
3.  **The Scientific Revolution** (500 years ago)
    *   Admission of ignorance.
    *   Marriage of science and empire.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Imagined Orders**: Money, empires, and religions are all inter-subjective realities. They exist only because we believe in them.
*   **Happiness**: Are we happier than our hunter-gatherer ancestors? Harari suggests probably not.

## My Thoughts

A provocative read that challenges our assumptions about progress and human nature.
