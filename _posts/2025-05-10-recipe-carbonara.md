Forget cream. Real Carbonara uses only four ingredients (plus pasta).

## Ingredients

*   **Guanciale** (Cured pork jowl): 150g
*   **Pecorino Romano**: 100g, grated
*   **Eggs**: 3 large yolks + 1 whole egg
*   **Black Pepper**: Freshly cracked, lots of it
*   **Spaghetti**: 400g

## Instructions

1.  **Prep the Meat**: Cut the guanciale into strips. Fry in a pan over medium heat until crispy. Remove meat, leave fat.
2.  **Make the Sauce**: Whisk eggs, Pecorino, and pepper in a bowl until it forms a thick paste.
3.  **Cook Pasta**: Boil spaghetti in salted water until *al dente*.
4.  **Combine**:
    *   Transfer pasta to the pan with guanciale fat (off heat).
    *   Add a splash of pasta water.
    *   Pour in the egg mixture and toss vigorously.

> **Warning**: Do not scramble the eggs! The heat from the pasta is enough to cook them into a creamy sauce.
